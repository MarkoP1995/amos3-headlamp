Currently we ship a Linux desktop application as an AppImage file. So you
can just run the application using the downloaded file.

To download, choose the latest AppImage file from the [releases page](https://github.com/kinvolk/headlamp/releases).
You can then run it by doing:

```bash
./Headlamp.AppImage
```
