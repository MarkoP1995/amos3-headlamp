This section will walk you through a basic plugin development.

## Types

If you are using Typescript for developing the plugin, the `@kinvolk/headlamp-plugin` package does
ship some type declarations in `@kinvolk/headlamp-plugin/types`.
Please notice that the whole external plugin mechanics are still in an early development phase
and thus only the actual type declarations (and not the corresponding code) is shipped in this package at the moment.


```typescript
import { Plugin } from '@kinvolk/headlamp-plugin/types/plugin/index.d';
```

## Plugin Class

Plugins are classes that register actions when they are initialized.

A plugin class needs an `initialize` method which receives a `register`
class that offers ways to register different types of actions in the web UI.

Besides declaring the plugin, an instance of it needs to be registered using
the `window.registerPlugin` method.

The following example will show a basic plugin declaration and registration
in a file that should match the `src/index.tsx` structure explained in the
[building](./building) section.


```typescript
import { Plugin } from '@kinvolk/headlamp-plugin/types/plugin/index.d';
import Registry from '@kinvolk/headlamp-plugin/types/plugin/registry';

class MyPlugin implements Plugin {
  initialize(register: Registry) {
    // Actual actions registration goes here

    // At the moment the return value is ignored, but it will be used
    // to determine whether the plugin could be initialized.
    return true;
  }
}

window.registerPlugin('my-plugin', new MyPlugin());
```

## Plugin Example

Let's create a plugin that just gets the number of pods in the cluster and
displays that information in the top bar (i.e. registers an "app bar action").

```tsx
import { Plugin } from '@kinvolk/headlamp-plugin/types/plugin/index.d';
import Registry from '@kinvolk/headlamp-plugin/types/plugin/registry.d';

const pluginLib = window.pluginLib;
const React = window.pluginLib.React;
const K8s = pluginLib.K8s.ResourceClasses;
const { Typography } = pluginLib.MuiCore;

function PodCounter() {
  const [pods, error] = K8s.Pod.useList();
  const msg = pods === null ? 'Loadingâ€¦' : pods.length.toString();

  return (
      <Typography color="textPrimary">{!error ? `# Pods: ${msg}` : 'Uh, pods!?'}</Typography>
  );
}

class PodCounterPlugin implements Plugin {
  initialize(register: Registry) {
    register.registerAppBarAction('monitor', () =>
      <PodCounter />
    );

    return true;
  }
}

window.registerPlugin('pod-counter', new PodCounterPlugin());
```

Here is the result, running Headlamp with this plugin and using with a Minikube cluster:

Please refer to the [functionality](./functionality.md) section for learning about
the different functionality that is available to plugins by the registry.
